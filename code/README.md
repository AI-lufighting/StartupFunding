We created basic sentiment features and fine-grained emotion features for startup profile texts. 
Furthermore, we proposed a startup funding success and amount analysis framework. 
In more detail,  based on emotional features, we use the six most common machine learning methods for classifying startup funding success and predicting financing amounts. 
To improve the performance of the neural network model, we propose a feature fusion model incorporating the textCNN method.
